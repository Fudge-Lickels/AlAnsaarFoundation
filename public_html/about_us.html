      <p> 
          
          
          A group of prominent businessmen set out to establish The Al Ansaar Foundation in 1994 in the hope of uplifting and improving the community.
           While there were already other organizations in existence, these visionaries understood that it was their duty to address issues which they felt had been neglected.
           Therefore, The Al Ansaar Foundation was established to form an infrastructure to restore values and practices among South Africans and ultimately to reach communities. 
           As a result, society will be more enlightened, educated and informed, thus empowering people to become active members of their respective communities.
           The Al Ansaar Foundation has grown to achieve a track record of being one of the most progressive and active organizations in South Africa. </p><br>
