        <h3>The Al-Ansaar Foundation was inaugurated in 1993 (1414 AH) by a group of concerned Muslim businessmen, whose desire was to uplift, educate and revive the Ummah.<br>
           Today, the foundation runs a number of projects including Radio Al Ansaar, the Mariam Bee Sultan Pre-School, Ibn Masud Centre of Excellence for children with special needs, and an annual Souk Trade Fair.<br>
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p> A group of prominent businessmen set out to establish The Al Ansaar Foundation in 1994 in the hope of uplifting and improving the community.<br>

While there were already other organizations in existence, these visionaries understood that it was their duty to address issues which they felt had been neglected. <br>
Therefore, The Al Ansaar Foundation was established to form an infrastructure to restore values and practices among South Africans and ultimately to reach communities.<br>
As a result, society will be more enlightened, educated and informed, thus empowering people to become active members of their respective communities.<br>
<br>
The Al Ansaar Foundation has grown to achieve a track record of being one of the most progressive and active organisations in South Africa. <br>
Since 1994, the Al Ansaar Foundation has established steadfast projects to assist and aid both Islamic and Non-Islamic Communities such as:<br>
 <ul> <li>
Radio Al Ansaar<br>
Al Ansaar Souk Trade Fair<br>
Ibn Masud Centre of Excellence<br>
Al Ansaar Book and Media Centre<br>
Mariam Bee Sultan Pre School and Montessori<br>
Etazkiyyah Centres for Learning<br>
Eid Feeding Schemes (Outreach Programme)<br>
Seminars (Hajj/ Umrah included)<br>
Wheelchair & Walking Aid Distribution Programmes<br>
Cancer Support Group<br>
Disaster Relief Programmes<br>
